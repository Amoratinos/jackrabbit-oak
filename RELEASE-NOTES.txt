New configuration options in Oak 1.0.20

Changes in Oak 1.0.20
---------------------

This release of Oak includes an improvement to the DocumentNodeStore,
which requires a new collection in the DocumentStore. The DocumentStore
implementations in Oak will try to create the new collection if necessary.
However, there may be deployments where the configured backend storage user
for the DocumentStore implementation does not have the require privilege.
In this case it is required to create the table for the RDB backend or 
collection for MongoDB manually before Oak is upgraded to 1.0.20.
See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-2829 for more details.

Node name index support (OAK-1752) - With this queries involving
node name constraint can make use of index and perform better. Refer to
http://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/query/lucene.html#index-node-name
for usage details.
