---------------------

Bug

    [OAK-8582] - Failing test in MongoDB 4.2.0: BasicDocumentStoreTest.testLongId
    [OAK-9176] - sweep upgrade of pre 1.8 branch commits not always sets "_bc" for parents/root
    [OAK-9306] - Faceting: IllegalArgumentException: dimension ... was not indexed
    [OAK-9358] - DocumentNodeStore may accumulate split candidates

Improvement

    [OAK-9134] - Remove mix:referenceable from nt:frozenNode definition
    [OAK-9290] - Respect nt:frozenNode definition on upgrade and migration
    [OAK-9291] - Refactor check for referenceable nt:frozenNode definition
    [OAK-9352] - move SystemPropertySupplier from document to commons
    [OAK-9357] - Update to MongoDB Java driver 3.12

This release contains a fix for OAK-9176, which performs a one time repository
scan to fix missing _bc (branch commit) entries. This only affects repositories
running on DocumentNodeStore (MongoDB and RDB). Use the system property
-Doak.documentMK.disableSweep2=true to disable this scan in case it should be
skipped explicitly.

In addition to the above-mentioned changes, this release contains
all changes included up to the previous Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.22.x release.
